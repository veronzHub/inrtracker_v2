## Overview

Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication commonly prescribed to individuals at risk of blood clots or those with certain cardiovascular conditions. It works by inhibiting the body's ability to form blood clots, thus reducing the risk of conditions such as strokes, heart attacks, and pulmonary embolisms.

However, managing Warfarin therapy can be challenging due to its narrow therapeutic range. The effectiveness of Warfarin is monitored through a blood test called the International Normalized Ratio (INR). INR measures the time it takes for blood to clot and compares it to the normal range. For most individuals, an INR within the range of 2.0 to 3.0 is considered therapeutic.

Maintaining the INR within this range is crucial for the effectiveness and safety of Warfarin therapy. If the INR is too low, it may not adequately prevent blood clots, while if it's too high, it increases the risk of bleeding complications.

Managing Warfarin treatment requires frequent INR monitoring and adjustments to dosage schedules based on the test results. Patients must adhere to their prescribed dosage schedules and communicate any missed or incorrect dosages to their healthcare providers to ensure optimal treatment outcomes.

INRTracker aims to simplify this process by providing a user-friendly platform for individuals to log their INR levels, dosage schedules, and track adherence to their Warfarin treatment plans. By empowering patients with tools to actively participate in their treatment management, INRTracker promotes better health outcomes and enhances communication between patients and healthcare providers.
